            <h2>Recursion:</h2>

            <h2>Recursion:</h2>
            <div class="sub-point">
                <h3>Base Case:</h3>
                <p>Always ensure that there is at least one base case in your recursive function. This base case defines when the recursion should stop and serves as the termination condition.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="sub-point">
                <h3>Progress Towards Base Case:</h3>
                <p>Each recursive call should move closer to the base case, either directly or indirectly, to ensure that the recursion converges and eventually terminates.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="sub-point">
                <h3>Stack Overflow Risk:</h3>
                <p>Be mindful of the risk of stack overflow when dealing with deep or unbounded recursion. Consider using techniques like tail recursion optimization or iterative approaches for large inputs.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="sub-point">
                <h3>State Management:</h3>
                <p>Understand how state is managed through function parameters, return values, and the call stack in recursive functions. Ensure that state is correctly updated and propagated through recursive calls.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="sub-point">
                <h3>Recursive Leap of Faith:</h3>
                <p>Trust that recursive calls work correctly for smaller subproblems. Focus on understanding how the problem can be divided into smaller instances and delegate their solution to recursive calls.</p>
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="point">
            <h2>Iteration:</h2>
            <div class="sub-point">
                <h3>Loop Condition:</h3>
                <p>Define a loop condition that determines when the iteration should stop. Ensure that the loop condition is properly defined to avoid infinite loops.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="sub-point">
                <h3>Initialization:</h3>
                <p>Initialize loop variables or data structures before entering the loop to ensure proper execution and prevent undefined behavior.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="sub-point">
                <h3>Termination:</h3>
                <p>Ensure that the loop terminates either by reaching the end of the loop body or by explicitly breaking out of the loop when the desired condition is met.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="sub-point">
                <h3>Increment or Decrement:</h3>

        <div class="recursion bucket">
            <h2>Recursion:</h2>
            <p>Use recursion when:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>The problem can be broken down into smaller subproblems that are identical in structure to the original problem.</li>
                <li>Problems that are naturally recursive, such as tree traversal, depth-first search, and certain types of sorting algorithms (e.g., quicksort, mergesort), are good candidates for recursion.</li>
                <li>Recursion can lead to more concise and elegant solutions, especially for problems that involve hierarchical or nested structures.</li>
                <li>However, recursion may lead to stack overflow errors if the depth of recursion is too large.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="iteration bucket">
            <h2>Iteration:</h2>
            <p>Use iteration when:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>The problem can be solved by repeating a set of instructions iteratively.</li>
                <li>Problems that involve sequential or linear processing, such as array manipulation, searching, and certain types of sorting algorithms (e.g., insertion sort, bubble sort), are often better suited for iteration.</li>
                <li>Iteration is usually more memory-efficient than recursion, as it doesn't involve maintaining a call stack.</li>
                <li>Iteration can be more straightforward and easier to understand for certain types of problems, especially those that don't have a natural recursive structure.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <p>In some cases, you can convert recursive solutions to iterative solutions and vice versa, depending on the requirements and constraints of the problem. Additionally, some programming languages may have limitations on recursion depth or stack size, which can influence the choice between recursion and iteration.</p>

        <p>Ultimately, the decision between recursion and iteration should be based on factors such as clarity, efficiency, and the specific characteristics of the problem being solved.</p>
